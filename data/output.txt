Water, also known as H2O, is a liquid that exists in various forms depending on temperature and pressure. At room temperature (21°C or 70°F), water molecules are arranged in a single layer along the surface of water droplets. As temperature and pressure increase, the surface becomes more irregular, and the water droplets become smaller and denser, until they finally evaporate to form tiny droplets of vapor (ice or fog) or condensed liquid (dew or rain). The liquid phase (i.e., water as a solid or liquid) is often referred to as "water," while the gas phase (i.e., water as a vapor, cloud, or mist) is called "water vapor."
