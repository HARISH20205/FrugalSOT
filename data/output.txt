Deep Learning is a type of machine learning that involves building models with multiple layers or neurons in the neural network. It involves solving complex problems by learning from massive amounts of data, which can be difficult for traditional linear regression and support vector machines (SVMs). In deep learning, the network is built using these deep layers that allow it to learn patterns in a variety of inputs, including high-dimensional data sets. Unlike other machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines or naive Bayes, deep learning can handle complex tasks with limited training data and can provide accurate predictions for unseen or unknown data. Deep learning is widely used in various fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and healthcare.
